# How I learned css <img alt="GIF" src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/headbang.gif" width="40" height="40" />
Here I will be documenting my entire day-1 lesson of whatever I did to learn css. This is written by me purely for any future references and also to keep a track of important steps which might help me when I get stuck. This is not a tutorial from my end and I am open to any suggestions from my peers.

**Note:** This writing might help you only if you are a complete beginner.

## Pre-Requisite
Whenever I start learning anything new, I tend to go with a project based learning. Hence, I will be making a To-Do Web App which will perform all the basic CRUD Operations and I will later deploy it on Heroku. To begin with, I have two tools installed in my local system:
1. VS Code
2. Anaconda (Using Conda Python helps me with my ML Projects)

## Phase 0
To begin with we should know the basics of html. We can refer it from [here](https://github.com/ayushi200124/my-html-journey)

## Phase 1
**DOM or Document Object Model** is a model which is created by a browser while loading a page and it works as a tree of objects. 

*Note: When an html element is given an id, it serves as a unique identifier for that element but on the other hand when an html element is given a class, it now belongs to that class. More than one element can belong to one class but every element must have one unique id (if assigned).*
```
<div id="first" class=" c1 c2 c3">
<! –– only one unique id and multiple classes assigned to one element using spaces ––>
</div>
```
**There are 3 ways to add css to html. They are**

- `<style>` tag: Adding `<style> ... </style>` tag into html
- Inline css: Adding css using style attribute
- External css: Adding a stylesheet(.css) to html using `<link>` tag

**CSS Selector**

A css selector is used to select an html element for styling 
```
body {                <! –– selector ––>
    color: red;       <! –– declaration (property: value) ––>
    background: pink; <! –– declaration (property: value) ––>
    }
```
